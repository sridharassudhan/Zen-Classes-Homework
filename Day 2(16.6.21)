IS IT NECESSARY TO USE HEAD,BODY TAGS
Omitting the html, head, and body tags is certainly allowed 
by the HTML specs. The underlying reason is that browsers 
have always sought to be consistent with existing web pages, 
and the very early versions of HTML didn't define those 
elements. 
HEAD
The HTML <head> element represents a collection of metadata 
about the document, including links to or definitions of 
scripts and style sheets.

This means that everything that goes in the <head> tag is not
seen by the user (basically),but is used to include relevant 
information and dynamic content that is processed by the 
browser.
BODY
The HTML <body> element represents the content of an HTML 
document. There is only one <body> element in a document.

This means that everything that the user sees on the page 
goes in the <body> tag (basically), and that there is only 
one.

You could omit the head and body tags in your page because 
this is certainly allowed by the HTML specs.

<div>
The <div> tag defines a division or a section in an HTML 
document. The <div> tag is used as a container for HTML 
elements - which is then styled with CSS or manipulated with 
JavaScript. The <div> tag is easily styled by using the class 
or id attribute. Any sort of content can be put inside the 
<div> tag.

<article>
The <article> tag specifies independent, self-contained 
content.
An article should make sense on its own and it should be 
possible to distribute it independently from the rest of the 
site.
Potential sources for the <article> element:
-Forum post
-Blog post
-News story

<section>
Section tag defines the section of documents such as chapters, 
headers, footers or any other sections. The section tag divides 
the content into section and subsections. The section tag is 
used when requirements of two headers or footers or any other 
section of documents needed.
