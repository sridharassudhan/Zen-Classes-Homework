@5 differences between node js and javascript
1.Javascript is a programming language 
that is used for writing scripts on the website.	NodeJS is a Javascript runtime environment.

2.Javascript can only be run in the browsers.	        NodeJS code can be run outside the browser.

3.It is basically used on the client-side.	        It is mostly used on the server-side.

4.Javascript is used in frontend development.	        Nodejs is used in server-side development.

5.Javascript can run in any browser engine as           Nodejs can only run in V8 engine of google 
 like JS core in safari and Spidermonkey in Firefox.    chrome.

@HTTP1.1 vs 2
Multiplexing: 
*HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all 
the other resources behind it. 
*HTTP/2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no 
one resource blocks any other resource.

@Scripting language vs programming language
*Basically, all scripting languages are programming languages.scripting languages do not require 
the compilation step and are rather interpreted.
*Generally, compiled programs run faster than interpreted programs because they are first converted
to native machine code.
*Another point to be noted is that while classifying a language as scripting language or 
programming language, the environment on which it would execute must be taken into consideration.

@Dynamic vs Static Typing
*In Dynamic Typing, type checking is performed at runtime.
 It means that the type of a variable is allowed to change over its lifetime

*In Static Typing, type checking is performed during compile time.
 It means that the type of a variable is known at compile time.
